My Process
-No previous experience with REST APIs. Started learning about REST APIs with Lynda’s courses, youtube videos, articles, and trial and error through code. 
-Started off with LinkedIn's REST API. Learned how to get OAuth code for an access token to be able to have access to API. Switched to Crunchbase API after learning that I needed a partnership with LinkedIn for peoples’ profile data. 
-Although I was limited to only ODM(Open Data Map) data on Crunchbase API, I was able to extract what I needed, such as Alumnus names and social-media URLs. 

What I’ve learned
-Persistence: I’ve had a lot of code errors while developing the code. I understand that even though I did not have as much experience as other programmers(4 months of learning python from August-December 2019) I knew I was capable of developing the code through self-learning and trial and error, just like I did with my previous internship on web scraping. I did not understand how to work with JSON data and getting API access with Python module requests until I started learning the documentation and youtube tutorials and also writing the code. I’ve used my previous internship experience to assist myself in writing the code. 
- Beliving in myself: Doing this API project was huge for me since I have never worked with APIs. I always tell myself that “I can do this” and trust me, it works like magic. I believe in what I can deliver to achieve the results so believing in myself is exactly what led to my success in building the final code. 
-Problem-solving: For programmers out there, you know what’s it like coding. It’s all about problem-solving trying to figure out how to fix certain bugs and write correct code for the program to work. That is exactly what I did. I had errors throughout the code development and I pretty much had to Google how to do certain things, such as learning how to work with JSON data and its different commands(Ex. json.dumps/dump, json.load/json.loads). Also, I had to learn how to work with HTTP, requests module, and PostMan to get API information from client to server. 
-Creativity: I understand that there are millions of ways to write code to perform a task. First and foremost, knowing what the result should be allowed me to develop my own process to achieve the result. For example, the task was to get organization names and social media URLs from Cunbase API, and I would ask myself, “Would the data be in a CSV file or pdf? How would it look like?” These questions help me form my own way of writing the code.
