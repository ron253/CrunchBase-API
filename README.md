# CrunchBase-API-Santa-Clara-University-Relations
About
Helped the Prospect Management and Analytics team in extracting SCU Alumnus' social media URLs and organization names using Crunchbase API. The purpose of this project is to have the social media URLs and organization info. of Alumnus to be inputted onto the database. 


My Process
-Started learning about REST APIs with Lynda’s courses, youtube videos, articles, and trial and error through code. 
-Started off with LinkedIn's REST API. Learned how to get OAuth code for an access token to be able to have access to API. --Switched to Crunchbase API after learning that getting data of SCU Alumnus data requires a partnership with LinkedIn. 
-Although I was limited to only ODM(Open Data Map) data on Crunchbase API, I was able to extract what I needed, such as Alumnus names and social-media URLs. 

What I’ve learned
-Rest APIs
-Working with JSON data and dictionaries
-Get/Post Requests
