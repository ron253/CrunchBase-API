# CrunchBase

**What is this code for?**
I wrote this code to make GET requests from Crunchbase API to enchance SCU consitutents' database with additional contact information that did not exist previously. <br/>

**Fun fact**
I did not have previous knowledge of working with API's. Everything was learned on the job when I worked as a prospect analytics assistant at SCU. <br/>

**What Iâ€™ve learned** <br/>
-Rest APIs <br/>
-Working with JSON data and dictionaries </br>
-Get/Post Requests  </br>
